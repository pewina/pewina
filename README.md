### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Pewina Francy!

ðŸŽ“I'm a second-year student studying Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at Jerusalem College of Engineering, Chennai.

ðŸ’¡I enjoy building cool projects, learning new things, and exploring how tech can solve real-world problems.  
ðŸŽ¨Right now, I'm working on things like a period tracker website, weather prediction website and learning more and UI/UX design.

Figuring things out as I build them.
Thanks for stopping by!
